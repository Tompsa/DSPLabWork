Digital signal processing labwork

The goal of this project was to implement stereo disparity algorithm for depth estimation between
two images. The chosen method was sum of squared differences (SSD) blockmatching algorithm. In
SSD, the differences are squared and aggregated within a square window and later optimized by
winner-takes-all (WTA) strategy. As a result we get a depth map between two images. A second
depth map was produced for post-processing purposes. 
Heterogeneous implementation involved running the host code on CPU and the computationally intensive parts
were parallelized and offloaded to GPU as kernels using OpenCL.
